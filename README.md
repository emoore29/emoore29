<h2 align="center">Hi, I'm Emma.</h2>

* 🕸 I make websites using React.
* 🌱 I'm currently learning React Native and improving my foundational JavaScript knowledge.
* 🎨 I enjoy the intersection of creativity and practicality, e.g., using colour theory to create unique colour palettes that are also accessible.
* 🔮 In my spare time, I'm developing concepts for a DnD-inspired fantasy mobile game.
